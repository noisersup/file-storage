:warning: **This project is still in progress and does not meet 100% of its assumptions DO NOT use it to store any of your sensitive files** :warning:
# :closed_lock_with_key: Encrypted File Server
:file_folder:**Open source encrypted file server written for privacy and fun.**

It takes your files, make them unreadable and place them next to other files looking like effect of keysmash

## Project assumptions
- multiple users support
- all files stored in one directory
- the whole file tree is stored in encrypted database with encrypted filenames
- only owner of the key can see filenames and their content
